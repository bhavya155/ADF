
# Azure Data Factory Pipelines - Data Ingestion & Transformation Project

This project contains a collection of Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines designed to perform various data ingestion and transformation tasks from diverse sources, with a focus on scalability, parameterization, and modularity.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project handles multiple ingestion pipelines that move data from:
- On-premises SQL Server to cloud storage
- Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) to cloud targets
- Azure Blob Storage and HTTP sources for COVID data analysis

These pipelines are configured using ADF's parameterization capabilities and support scalable transformation logic through Data Flows.
